# Covid Analysis
This is a covid analysis project in which I tried to find out the countries which performed and managed well in the covid crisis.
Here the analysis is done on the basis of:
1. Total number of cases.
2. Total population of the country.

Here total number of cases means, I've analyzed the countries whose total number of cases were very high and still they mananged in this condition.
and based on the population means, I've analyzed the countries whose total population high and still they mananged in this condition.

## Note: After cleaning and calculating required variables, i have selected only top 10 countries/row entries.

All the datasets used in this project has been provided in the repo itself, you can find in there.

Also, mainly there are two files:
1. Covid analysis(total cases).ipynb
2. covid_analysis(population).ipynb

from the name itself you can guess that the first file analysis is based upon total number of covid cases.(top covid cases counties have been given more priority)
and Second file analysis is based upon the Population of the country.(High populated countries in the world have been given more priority)

## You can find the requirements.txt file in the repo itself, 

## Your suggestions are welcomed _/\_
